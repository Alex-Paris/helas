>To fetch the results, a request will need to be made to the following url: https://aio.server9.nelios.com/ with bearer token: "QcKjgrWuKr0mYaavwwtpSvk7MyWhyWh3k0Secv".

>If done correctly the endpoint will return a response with dummy json data. These will feed the list of results. In this list, sorting functionalities (ascending/descending price and alphabetical) as well as filtering by price and categories (meal_plan) can be implemented.


>It is not necessary to complete all of the above, obviously the more complete the better. We want to see your best self in the above exercise because from the result of the test we will form the final list. The axes of the evaluation will be related to the quality and purity of the code, the overall approach to the solution, the responsiveness and the precise performance of your front-end with Figma.
